# ms-adventure

This was my MS Graduation practicum project. I have used MEAN stack to develope this site. I part of this project journey, I learned about NodeJS, AngularJS, ExpressJs and MongoDb.

You will notice I have used various AngularJS patterns and techniques.

(Note: This is my study project and I do not provide any guarantee/warranty. Please use this code as reference. )

## How to run website locally?

1. Clone code repository on your local box with GIT CLONE command
2. Open GIT bash considoring you are using windows machine
3. Navigate to cloned directory
4. CD into "app" folder
5. Run command "NODE app.js"
6. Access application ad http://localhost:3000
